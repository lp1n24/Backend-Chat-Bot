Problem: Build a backend chatbot that answers questions based on the provided academic PDFs.

Specification:
- Answer questions using knowledge retrieved from the provided academic PDFs.
- Ability to handle vague questions (maybe ask for clarification?)
- Use web search ONLY when explicitly requested by the user OR when the chatbot cannot answer the query using the provided knowledge.

Passing Criteria:
- Ingest at least one PDF and build a retrieval index
- Provide query -> return answer + reference used academic PDFs
- Provide session-based memory with any ability to answer follow-up questions
- Ability to clear session memory (using RESTful API)
- Service runs via basic container (using docker-compose)
- A README file that contains architecture design, agent descriptions, how to run, trade-offs and future implementation

Assumptions:
- Language: Python
- Application server: FastAPI
- LLM provider: OpenAI
- FAISS for local RAG
- LangGraph-based multi-agent architecture

Extra:
- Frontend UI
